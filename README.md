# set-up-dev-machine
Publicly hosted script to bootstrap an Ubuntu VM

## Pre-Reqs
If you are using Github 2 Factor Auth, the only pre-req is that the Ubuntu VM is configured with an SSH key that is in your Github profile. Other than that, run the script below, and you'll be set up!

## Set me up!
`sudo apt install curl -y && bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpryor/set-up-dev-machine/master/bootstrap.sh)`
